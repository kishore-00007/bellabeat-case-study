# 1. Business Task

Bellabeat, a wellness company for women, wants to gain insights from smart device (Fitbit) data to improve its marketing strategy.  
As a data analyst, I will identify trends in user activity, sleep, and calories — and suggest recommendations for one of their products (e.g., Leaf or Time).

*Goal:*  
Turn real-world behavior patterns into data-driven marketing strategies.

# 2. Data Preparation

{r load-and-clean}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(janitor)

# Load data
daily_activity <- read_csv("data/dailyActivity_merged.csv")
sleep_day <- read_csv("data/sleepDay_merged.csv")
weight_log <- read_csv("data/weightLogInfo_merged.csv")

# Clean column names
daily_activity <- clean_names(daily_activity)
sleep_day <- clean_names(sleep_day)
weight_log <- clean_names(weight_log)

# Fix date formats
daily_activity <- daily_activity %>%
  mutate(activity_date = mdy(activity_date))

sleep_day <- sleep_day %>%
  mutate(sleep_day = mdy_hms(sleep_day))

# Remove duplicates
daily_activity <- daily_activity %>% distinct()
sleep_day <- sleep_day %>% distinct()
weight_log <- weight_log %>% distinct()

# 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

## Steps Summary
{r steps-summary}
daily_activity %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(total_steps), median = median(total_steps))


## Calories vs Active Minutes
{r calories-vs-active}
ggplot(daily_activity, aes(x = very_active_minutes, y = calories)) +
  geom_point(color = "purple") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Very Active Minutes vs Calories Burned",
       x = "Very Active Minutes", y = "Calories Burned")


## Sleep Duration
{r sleep-summary}
sleep_day %>%
  summarise(avg_sleep = mean(total_minutes_asleep) / 60,
            median_sleep = median(total_minutes_asleep) / 60)


## Sleep Histogram
{r sleep-histogram}
ggplot(sleep_day, aes(x = total_minutes_asleep / 60)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "darkgreen", bins = 20) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Sleep Duration", x = "Hours Asleep", y = "Count of Days")


# 4. Key Insights

- Users who are more active burn more calories — strong positive correlation.
- Average sleep is 6.99 hours; most users sleep less than 7 hours.
- Few users consistently meet 10,000 steps/day. Many are moderately active.

# 5. Recommendations for Bellabeat

1. Market the *Leaf* or *Time* to active users who want to monitor calories.
2. Emphasize *sleep tracking features* to help users improve rest habits.
3. Promote *“7k Steps a Day” app challenges* to build consistent habits.
4. Use *push notifications + Instagram ads* for engagement.

# 6. Final Thoughts

Bellabeat can use these insights to drive more engagement by aligning its app and products with real user behavior seen in the Fitbit dataset.
